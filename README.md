# drop-dynamics, moving-camera video, template-matching, normalized cross-correlation
A MATLAB code which reads numbers in a video, references, and calculates drop dynamics' characteristics 

Brief summary: The MATLAB code reads a number in a video frame using template matching (normalized cross-correlation algorithm). 
Further, it references the pixels accordingly considering the parallax between the scale and the object (drop). 
Finally, it calculates the object (drop) characteristics such as height from the free surface, velocity, aspect ratio, etc.
In a nutshell, the code can be used where the camera moves with the object but a fixed ruler in the image can be used for referencing.
